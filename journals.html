CS1 reflection
10-21-20

-So far in CS1 I have learned to create divs and edit them so that they can have my own images in them and so that they can spin and change pictures. I learned codes in css and html, and a little bit of javascript. I learned how to add text into my own website and change the color, font, and size. I have learned how to make my own website with my own code. I have also learned how to plan for a code and write a codesketch which is helpful because it works like a blueprint for my code.
<b></b>-Something that has been frustrating is missing something in class that is very important to make my code work. I combat this by following along with Ms.Josephs and type code at the same time. I also ask other people in breakout rooms who caught what I missed. Other things that have been frustrating are when zoom kicks me out of a meeting and I miss something and other times when my computer does not download things I need for class in time.
-I have been feeling excited for a while, I am excited to try a bunch of new things in code, and explore new things.
-Labs have also been very helpful and fun and allow me to catch up on things that I may have missed during class.
-Something I want to work on is creating creative codes and not being afraid to do something because it seems hard or complicated. I will work on this by doing my own research to help. I also want to work on the code for my website so that it is fun and cool.
