-So far in CS1 I have learned to create divs and edit them so that they can have my own images in them and so that they can spin and change pictures. I learned codes in css and html, and a little bit of javascript. I learned how to add text into my own website and change the color, font, and size. I have learned how to make my own website with my own code. I have also learned how to plan for a code and write a codesketch which is helpful because it works like a blueprint for my code.<br/><br/>

-Something that has been frustrating is missing something in class that is very important to make my code work. I combat this by following along with Ms.Josephs and type code at the same time. I also ask other people in breakout rooms who caught what I missed. Other things that have been frustrating are when zoom kicks me out of a meeting and I miss something and other times when my computer does not download things I need for class in time.<br/><br/>

-I have been feeling excited for a while, I am excited to try a bunch of new things in code, and explore new things.<br/><br/>

-Labs have also been very helpful and fun and allow me to catch up on things that I may have missed during class.<br/><br/>

-Something I want to work on is creating creative codes and not being afraid to do something because it seems hard or complicated. I will work on this by doing my own research to help. I also want to work on the code for my website so that it is fun and cool.

Let's get down to business, to defeat the Huns
Did they send me daughters, when I asked for sons?
You're the saddest bunch I ever met
But you can bet before we're through
Mister, I'll make a man out of you<br>
Tranquil as a forest but on fire within
Once you find your center, you are sure to win
You're a spineless, pale, pathetic lot
And you haven't got a clue
Somehow I'll make a man out of you<br><br>
I'm never gonna catch my breath<br><br>
Say goodbye to those who knew me<br><br>
Boy, was I a fool in school for cutting gym<br><br>
This guy's got 'em scared to death<br><br>
Hope he doesn't see right through me<br><br>
Now I really wish that I knew how to swim<br><br>
Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon<br>
Time is racing toward us till the Huns arrive
Heed my every order and you might survive
You're unsuited for the rage of war
So pack up, go home, you're through
How could I make a man out of you?<br>
Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon
Be a man
We must be swift as the coursing river
Be a man
With all the force of a great typhoon
Be a man
With all the strength of a raging fire
Mysterious as the dark side of the moon<br><br>

This week I added alot to my website. I included a journals page linked to the journals button. I added gifs as background to different pages in my website and I really like how they look. <br>
-I learned a little more javascript, and I think I finally understand how to apply it to my website. I also learned how to update my website from the termianl every time I change something to make sure that it is updated on the internet. <br><br><br>
-Learning javascript was frusturating because I didn't fully understand how to use it on my website, I googled a few example codes and got the hang of it but I did not add any to my website yet. <br><br><br>
-I enjoy working in breakout rooms with several other classmate because it was super easy to ask someone for help and it feels nice to help someone else who might need it. I am excited to add more things to my website and put more projects in the projects folder.<br><br><br>
-Something I want to work on is learning and testing out javascript. I think it can make my website fun and interactive.<br>
